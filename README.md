##AIE314 Tutorial 1: Preprocessing Unstructured Data for LLM Applications

##Project Description
This project focuses on preprocessing unstructured data from various document formats (PDF, Word, Excel, PowerPoint, EPUB) and building a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) bot capable of handling mixed media (text + images). The goal is to enable large language models (LLMs) to effectively process and reason over diverse data sources.
